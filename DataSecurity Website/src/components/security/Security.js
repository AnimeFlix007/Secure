            Data security is the process of safeguarding digital information
            throughout its entire life cycle to protect it from corruption,
            theft, or unauthorized access. It covers everythingâ€”hardware,
            software, storage devices, and user devices; access and
            administrative controls; and organization's policies and procedures.
