            Cloud security is a collection of procedures and technology designed
            to address external and internal threats to business security.
            Organizations need cloud security as they move toward their digital
            transformation strategy and incorporate cloud-based tools and
            services as part of their infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cloud security is a responsibility that is shared between the cloud
            provider and the customer.
