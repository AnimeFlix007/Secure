          <p>
            Cloud providers follow best security practices and take active steps
            to protect the integrity of their servers. However, organizations
            need to make their own considerations when protecting data,
            applications, and workloads running on the cloud.
          </p>
          <p id="black">
            Security threats have become more advanced as the digital landscape
            continues to evolve. These threats explicitly target cloud computing
            providers due to an organization's overall lack of visibility in
            data access and movement
          </p>
          <p>
            Cloud security should be an important topic of discussion regardless
            of the size of your enterprise. Cloud infrastructure supports nearly
            all aspects of modern computing in all industries and across
            multiple verticals.
